Design Choices
==================
The *CoopIHC* module was written with two ideas in mind:

* simple standardized API, in line of Open AI's gym
* emphasis on modularity, to allow re-use of certain components, as well as allowing simulations of complex systems, such as those needed for reliable HCI modeling.
