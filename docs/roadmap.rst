.. roadmap:

Not only does coming up with realistic tasks and operators, and high performance assistants, take a lot of time, it also requires a different skill set. Realistic tasks require a good grasp of interface design, while operator modeling is based on the understanding of a human's various cognitive, motor capabilities. Good assistants on the other hand require advances planning strategies.

One of the ideas of *interaction-agents* is to separate each of these 'burdens'. One can for example implement a realistic HCI task, while another can work on an efficient planning strategy. The standard API makes sure that the two components will be inter-operable.

Another thing to look for is whether or not the interaction model is sufficient for most HCI scenarios. If not, the model should be updated to encompass more cases.

What's next ?
================

1. Fix the TODO list
2. Implement high fidelity HCI tasks,  e.g. menu selection, file navigation
3. Write a bundle where direct human control is possible
