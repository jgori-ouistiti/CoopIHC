class Bundle(BaseBundle):
    """Bundle

    Modifies the interface of the BaseBundle class.

    A bundle combines a task with a user and an assistant. The bundle creates the ``game_state`` by combining the task, user and assistant states with the turn index and both agent's actions.

    The bundle takes care of all the messaging between classes, making sure the gamestate and all individual states are synchronized at all times.

    The bundle implements a forced reset mechanism, where each state of the bundle can be forced to a particular state via a dictionnary mechanism (see :py:func:reset)

    The bundle also takes care of rendering each of the three component in a single place.
